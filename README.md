```
$ mvn package -Dvespa.version='7.244.2'     # You can specify 7.244.2 or later.
```

## Use Package

### Deploy

Put the built package to components directory of your service. If there is no components directory, create it. For example, the structure will be like below with sampleapps.

* sampleapps/search/music/
    * services.xml
    * components/
        * kuromoji-linguistics-${VERSION}-deploy.jar

### Configuration

Because the package will be used by searcher and indexer, it is recommended to define &lt;component&gt; in all &lt;jdisc&gt; sections of services.xml.

```
<container id="container" version="1.0">
    <component id="kuromoji" class="jp.co.yahoo.vespa.language.lib.kuromoji.KuromojiLinguistics" bundle="kuromoji-linguistics">
        <config name="language.lib.kuromoji.kuromoji">
            <mode>search</search>
            <ignore_case>true</ignore_case>
        </config>
    </component>
</container>
```

You can configure package by &lt;config name="language.lib.kuromoji.kuromoji"&gt; (optional). Parameters and default settings are below.
